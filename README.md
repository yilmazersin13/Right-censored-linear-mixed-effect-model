# Right-censored-linear-mixed-effect-model
Estimation of the right-censored data with linear mixed effects model basis on the penalized (regression) splines.
This study aims two main purposes. One is overcoming the right-censored observations with two different methods that are 
Kaplan-Meier weigts (Kaplan and Meier, 1958; Miller, 1976) and kNN imputation method (Batista and Monard, 2002). Second aim is estimation of the
linear mixed effects model with penazlied spline method which provides a advantage for dealing with a nonparametric regression function.
